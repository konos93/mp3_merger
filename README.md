How to Use

    Upon running the script, a GUI window will appear for file selection.
    Select one or more audio files that you want to concatenate. You can select files of any format.
    Click the "Open" button to confirm your selection.
    The script will concatenate the selected audio files into a single MP3 file named output.mp3.
    Once the concatenation is completed, the script will display a message indicating that the process is finished.
    The selected_files.txt file, which was temporarily created to list the selected files for FFmpeg, will be deleted automatically.
